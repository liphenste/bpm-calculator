## Setup
This app actually doesn't have any dependencies atm, the `package.json` is only there in case I want to add some in the future.

Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/liphenste/bpm-calculator
cd bpm-calculator
```

Run the server:
```bash
npm start
```

Then open your favourite browser and type `localhost:3000`.

## To Do
 - Rewrite BPM algorithm
 - Add Bootstrap styling
 - Set up MongoDB to store high scores, custom song BPMs
 - Find API that gets BPMs of known songs
 - Add Angular views that displays the songs
